EventCore looks like proposal software. It is not.

A catering company's real asset is not its documents. It is everything the company has learned: which menus work for which families, what a sushi station actually requires at 5 a.m. in the warehouse, how many staff a 250-guest event needs, which venue's loading dock ruins a timeline, what last May's wedding taught the kitchen. Today that knowledge lives in the owner's head, in a veteran chef's habits, in old spreadsheets nobody opens. When a person leaves, the company gets measurably worse at its own business.

EventCore's purpose is to make that impossible.

**EventCore is an organizational memory system for event operations.** Every event a company designs, sells, and executes leaves a permanent, searchable, reusable record — not just of what the customer saw, but of everything it took to deliver it. The next proposal starts from accumulated experience instead of a blank canvas.

## One word, defined once

**Evidence: a fact produced by the operation itself.** What was served, what it cost, what it required, who worked it, how it looked. Evidence is not entered into EventCore as an act of record-keeping; it is *generated* by running the business through it. The entire system keeps coming back to this word, so it is defined here and used identically everywhere (`KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §2).

## EventCore models reality

EventCore models the business itself, not the documents the business produces. **The design is the canonical representation of an event.** Every proposal, production sheet, packing list, invoice, schedule, checklist, and customer presentation is a projection generated from it. Documents are views; the design is the truth. This is why editing happens on the design and never on its outputs, and why the outputs can multiply without the truth fragmenting.

**The design is an object graph, not a document.** A design is composed of objects and their relationships: chapters contain components; components contain categories and items; venues, recipes, photographs, requirements, and people connect to them. Every operational layer projects from those same objects. The proposal, production sheets, warehouse packs, staffing plans, and floor layouts are different views over one graph — not separate documents synchronized after the fact. **There is nothing to keep in sync, because there is only one thing.**

Objects exist independently of the features that use them. Recipes do not belong to Kitchen; photos do not belong to a gallery; venues do not belong to a CRM. **Features discover objects; they do not own them.** Everything belongs to the graph.

## One source of truth

EventCore keeps exactly one authoritative representation of an event. Every layer, document, report, schedule, photograph, and operational view derives from it. **Multiple representations exist; multiple truths do not.**

## Every layer is equally real

Customer presentation, kitchen, production, warehouse, staffing, logistics, photography, floor design, purchasing, accounting — and layers not yet imagined — are different projections of the same design. **No layer is secondary.** The kitchen sheet is not an attachment to the proposal; the proposal is not more real than the packing list. They are the same event, seen by different people who have to make it happen. Any implementation that treats one layer as the "main" record and the others as accessories has misread this document.

## The Knowledge Cycle

Everything in the product serves one cycle:

```
        SEARCH  →  INSTANTIATE  →  EXECUTE  →  LEARN  →  PROMOTE
           ↑                                                │
           └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Search** — find what the company already knows.
**Instantiate** — turn knowledge into a live design in seconds, seeded across every layer it carries.
**Execute** — run the event; the design becomes the working plan for kitchen, warehouse, and floor.
**Learn** — the executed event becomes evidence.
**Promote** — a person deliberately turns the best of that evidence into the company's standard, and the next search finds it.

## Knowledge compounds

Knowledge does not merely accumulate — it compounds. Every event makes every future event easier to design, estimate, produce, and execute, because every execution contributes evidence that can later become curated knowledge. The Library is worth more after every successful event, the estimates get sharper, the blank page recedes further. This is the flywheel: the product improves because the company operates, not because the software changes.

## Knowledge is reused without loss

Instantiating a menu does not reduce it to customer-facing text. Every operational layer, requirement, photograph, relationship, and piece of provenance the object carries remains available wherever it is relevant. This is the difference between EventCore and copying a document: a copy keeps the words and loses the knowledge; an instantiation keeps everything the organization ever attached to the thing being reused.

## The moat

The competitive advantage is not templates. Templates are copy — anyone can ship a starter menu. **The moat is institutional memory that compounds through execution**: years of a company's own operations, searchable, connected by provenance, and validated by real events. A competitor can clone the interface in a quarter. They cannot clone a customer's accumulated evidence at all, and every month of operation widens the gap.

## What this displaces

Not other software. It displaces re-deciding. The competitor is the blank page, the from-scratch quote, the "call the guy who did one like this in 2023." A company running on EventCore never solves the same problem twice.

## What EventCore refuses to be

- **Not a document editor.** Documents are projections. The design is the asset.
- **Not an AI that makes things up.** The system states what happened and what people decided — computed facts, plainly, in past tense. **AI assists people. It never replaces evidence, provenance, or deliberate human decisions.** Whatever AI capabilities arrive, they are subject to this sentence, not the other way around.
- **Not a filing cabinet.** Knowledge is not stored in folders and remembered by location. It is found by intent, connected by provenance, and validated by use.

## The horizon

Any operation that designs, sells, and physically executes complex repeatable events. Initial market focus is business strategy and lives in strategy documents, which may change; this document should not have to.

## How these documents are used

`VISION.md`, `KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `UI_GRAMMAR.md`, and `ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md` function as the system's RFC base. Every architectural proposal begins by citing which sections it implements or amends. A proposal that cannot cite a section is either pulling the system in a new direction — in which case it must say so and propose the amendment first — or it does not belong.

## The one-sentence test

When evaluating any feature: *does it help the company remember, reuse, or improve what it already knows?* If not, it belongs somewhere else.

---

Every company already possesses institutional knowledge. Most of it disappears every day — in turnover, in forgetting, in the gap between the person who learned something and the person who needed it. EventCore exists so that what a company learns once becomes part of the company forever.
